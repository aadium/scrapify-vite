# Web Scraping App with React and Vite

This project is a web scraping application built using React.js with Vite, designed to scrape data from URLs specified by the user. It leverages modern web technologies to provide a seamless and efficient scraping experience. Additionally, the app includes AI-driven features such as summarization, categorization, and sentiment analysis to enhance the data processing capabilities. Users can view the scraped data on a separate output page and download it in JSON, CSV, or XML formats.
